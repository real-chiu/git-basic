My Answer for "Question 2. Your answer for What is the difference between add, commit, and push?" are as follow:

Given that we are having a local git repository, 
for any new changes, such as adding, deleting or modifying any files inside that git repository, 
"add" helps to include these changes (or maybe part of the changes, depending on what changes you choose to "add") for the next commit.

After including these changes by "add", we save these changes using "commit" with our commit message.

Up to this step, we are only modifying the local git repository.
To also update the commited changes to remote, we have to use "push" command to push them to remote.
We may specify what branch we are going to push our commited changes to.
